How a customer found us on HN & wrote us our First Angel cheque.

In an unlikeliest journey of what a startup can undergo - this is the story behind of how a hobby project posted on HN became a product. 
And then a customer found us on HN and decided to write us our first Angel Cheque.

# Background 
Before we begin, I've to mention that NocoDB in previous avatar was : 
- Xmysql - a hobby project & was first posted on HN.
  - Xmysql created instant REST APIs on any MySQL database. 
- Then XgeneCloud was an improvisation on Xmysql & was a desktop application which created API source code instantly on any database.

Whilst pivoting to NocoDB (Open Source Airtable). A customer found our previous posts on HackerNews. And decided to reach out to us.


# First meeting 
And I am late to meeting by 2 minutes. 

I am switching tabs. Then Chrome tabs.
- Mail. Click.
- Calendar. Click.
- Invitation. Click.

I join the meeting with a sheepish grin and say apologies for being late. 

This was my first meeting with Vasyl Rakivnenko he is Founder of Servired: a freight company that operates fleet taut-liner trucks across Europe.
- Quick intros exchanged.
- Backgrounds of each other exchanged.
- Vasyl describes there is an UI issue while loading certain fields.

# Meeting
Vasyl describes there is an UI issue while loading certain fields.
I ask Vasyl: "Let's create a fresh project".
And he opens up evernote to look up his AWS database credentials.
I ask him "Where did you come across us?"
He says "On HackerNews"
He checks me on the price of product.
I say "It's free & open source".
He says "Sorry, I don't get it?".
I checked whether he is unable to find database credentials.
He replies "I meant to ask why is the product free? You can charge me hourly if you can sort this issue out".
I say "Let's have a look, must be a bug on our end".

# Business Problem
Vasyl mentions trucking industry has a massive problem. It's DUI (Drink & Drive). 
If a driver gets into an accident and fails alcohol test later. 
The employer cannot claim insurance for the loss in accident. 
And that loss can be million+ Euros. 
And most likely the company will go bankrupt. 
Loss of livelihood for many families! 
He is envisaging a simple solution to begin with. 
A breathalyzer is present with each driver. 
And drivers can do breath checks during work hours. 
And results get dumped into cloud database via APIs & monitored.

So he has designed a  MySQL schema for the problem & wants APIs on top of that schema. 
Whilst he is not a programmer, but he has learnt skills out of frustration to solve the problem all by himself. 
There is much to like about him.

He is super pleased about our product on how its gonna help him. 
He still can't believe it is free! 
I tried to reason that NocoDB will be a fundamental right of every business on internet & hence open source. 
And I provide contact details just in case if he finds another bug and he can reach me on telegram directly.

# 30 minutes after our first meeting
Vasyl pings me on Telegram. He is not reaching out to mention a bug. Instead he is asking whether he can make an investment. Wow! He has turned a believer of the product & amazingly wants to help this to reach many problem solvers in the world. But how could I even expect that coming ? He queries on minimum size of cheque I mention a number. He wants to put thrice that number. Another zoom meeting. 
I am switching tabs. Then Chrome tabs. 
Mail. Click. 
Calendar. Click. 
Invitation. Click.
My first question : " What made him think to write an Angel cheque?" 
He talks about how painful the problem is in general. How treacherous his own journey has been to create a solution. Countless hours on internet. Lessons & expenditures from old IT projects. Outsourcing to companies. Working with freelancers. Code maintenance headaches. Endless meetings. 
He deeply understands IT solutions for non IT folks is a costly affair. However every small business now need an  IT solution of one form or the other. And he believes NocoDB in the hands of business owners can be a game changer. But hey thats usually my pitch to investors now its just reverse. So we nod in unison. And we smile. 
We arrive at an agreement. Quick handshake. All done virtually.

# Investment
I am in UK & SeedLegals makes it really simple to take investments. 
Its like Carta in US but SeedLegals are really responsive to queries. 
I signup with gmail. Then key in company details, total shares held when incorporated. 
For angel investment I used ASA/SeedFAST (equivalent to YC SAFE in US). 
Documents are well templated & assisted through out by SeedLegals.
Then I Click. Click. Click.
However, seedLegals take a 1% cut on every angel investment. Too pricey!! This has got to change.

# Announcing to team
One week later, I get a mobile notification that an investment has arrived. 
I first go to announce this to our youngest member of the team. 
She is looking at a Muhammad Ali's poster in the room. She is shadow boxing (almost). 
I announce to her that we got an angel cheque. She is still shadow boxing. 
I say its time for a picture. She doesn't say much. 
Any ways, I go ahead to take a picture and there she is caught giving a right cross to her own cheeks. 
She looks into me and smiles. With her, our entire team smiles. 
That's my daughter Gia & she is 3 months old.
And our journey continues helping one developer, one entrepreneur, one thinker of our times.
